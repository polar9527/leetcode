 * Testcase Example:  '[[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]'
 *
 * You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially
 * located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move
 * to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only
 * move either down or right at any point in time.
 *
 * An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that
 * the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.
 *
 * Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach
 * the bottom-right corner.
 *
 * The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to
 * 2 * 10^9.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
 * There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
 * 1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
 * 2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
 * Output: 1
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * m == obstacleGrid.length
 * n == obstacleGrid[i].length
 * 1 <= m, n <= 100
 * obstacleGrid[i][j] is 0 or 1.
