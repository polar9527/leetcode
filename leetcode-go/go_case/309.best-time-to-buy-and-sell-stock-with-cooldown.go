 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,0,2]'
 *
 * You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock
 * on the i^th day.
 *
 * Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many
 * transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock
 * multiple times) with the following restrictions:
 *
 *
 * After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e.,
 * cooldown one day).
 *
 *
 * Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you
 * must sell the stock before you buy again).
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: prices = [1,2,3,0,2]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: prices = [1]
 * Output: 0
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= prices.length <= 5000
 * 0 <= prices[i] <= 1000
 *
